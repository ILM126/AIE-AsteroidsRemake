# SpaceXterminator (Pre-Alpha)
The tug boats must be destroyed!
---

Inspired by SpaceX's [Falcon 9-022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9_Flight_22) Launch Attempt No. 3 on Sunday 28th of February, where a tug boat strayed into the retricted zone designated before lift off, 2 minutes before launch. Which caused the launch had to be delayed by 34 min before a last second launch abort that saw the launch be scrubbed 5 days later to the 4th of March. Where it successfully launched the sattelite, SES-9 into a Geostationary Transfer Orbit at at 11:35:00 UTC.

SpaceXterminator is based off the popular arcade game, Asteroids. Which you can have a go at playing the original game [here](http://www.freeasteroids.org/).

>This is a game being developed in Visual Studio 2015 using the MonoGame pipeline/engine for an Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) course, the 'Game Programming Cert II course'. ([link to course](http://www.aie.edu.au/courses/game_programming/certII_idmt_basic_game.html))
>The PDF file that we were given is uploaded with the repo, users may have a peek if you wish.

Note: This is the accumilation of all my knowledge that I have learnt about C# entirely since Feburay 2016, the code is a mess due to me writing most of it in the first few months of the course.
